# Email Notification System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND WORKING

Your South Delhi Real Estate project already has a **complete and functional nodemailer email notification system** that sends instant email notifications to the admin whenever users submit inquiries.

## 📧 Email Configuration

The system is configured to use your domain email with the exact credentials you specified:

```env
EMAIL_HOST=mail.southdelhirealty.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_SECURE=false
EMAIL_USER=admin@southdelhirealty.com
EMAIL_PASS=Biju@123
EMAIL_FROM=admin@southdelhirealty.com
```

## 🔧 System Components

### 1. Email Service (`server/email.ts`)
- ✅ Nodemailer configuration with your domain credentials
- ✅ HTML email templates with professional styling
- ✅ Plain text fallback for better compatibility
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ Email verification and testing functions

### 2. API Integration (`server/routes.ts`)
- ✅ `/api/inquiries` endpoint automatically triggers email notifications
- ✅ Fetches property details when available
- ✅ Handles both property-specific and general inquiries
- ✅ Error handling that doesn't break inquiry submission

### 3. Client-Side Forms
- ✅ **Property Inquiry Form** (`client/src/components/property/inquiry-form.tsx`)
- ✅ **General Contact Form** (`client/src/components/home/contact-section.tsx`)
- ✅ Both forms submit to the same endpoint and trigger emails
